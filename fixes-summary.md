# EventEase Application Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. React Key Prop Warnings
**Problem**: `AdminDashboard.jsx:205 Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.`

**Root Cause**: The database uses `id` field instead of `_id` field, but the frontend was trying to use `_id` as keys.

**Files Fixed**:
- `AdminDashboard.jsx`: Updated `event._id` and `booking._id` to `event.id` and `booking.id`
- `AdminUsers.jsx`: Updated `user._id` and `booking._id` to `user.id` and `booking.id`
- `AdminEvents.jsx`: Updated `event._id` to `event.id`
- `MyBookings.jsx`: Updated `booking._id` to `booking.id`

### 2. API 404 Error for User Details
**Problem**: `GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users/undefined 404 (Not Found)`

**Root Cause**: The `handleViewUser` function was being called with `user._id` which was undefined, causing the URL to become `/api/admin/users/undefined`.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated `AdminUsers.jsx` to use `user.id` instead of `user._id`
- Added validation in `handleViewUser` function to check if `userId` is valid before making the API call
- Added better error handling for failed API responses

### 3. Database Field Inconsistency
**Problem**: The application was using `_id` field references but the database uses `id` field.

**Solution**: Updated all frontend components to use `id` instead of `_id` for:
- React key props
- API endpoint parameters
- Object property access

## Files Modified

1. **AdminDashboard.jsx**
   - Line 203: `key={event._id}` → `key={event.id}`
   - Line 225: `key={booking._id}` → `key={booking.id}`

2. **AdminUsers.jsx**
   - Line 95: `key={user._id}` → `key={user.id}`
   - Line 124: `onClick={() => handleViewUser(user._id)}` → `onClick={() => handleViewUser(user.id)}`
   - Line 218: `key={booking._id}` → `key={booking.id}`
   - Added validation in `handleViewUser` function

3. **AdminEvents.jsx**
   - Line 66: `editingEvent._id` → `editingEvent.id`
   - Line 390: `key={event._id}` → `key={event.id}`

4. **MyBookings.jsx**

   - Line 141: `handleCancelBooking(booking._id)` → `handleCancelBooking(booking.id)`
   - Line 142: `cancellingId === booking._id` → `cancellingId === booking.id`
   - Line 146: `cancellingId === booking._id` → `cancellingId === booking.id`

## Testing

The fixes have been applied and the application should now:
- ✅ No longer show React key prop warnings
- ✅ Successfully fetch user details without 404 errors
- ✅ Display proper data in admin dashboard and user management pages
- ✅ Handle booking cancellations correctly

## Notes

- The database uses `id` field for all entities (users, events, bookings)
- All API endpoints expect `id` parameters, not `_id`
- Fallback keys have been added using index for cases where `id` might be undefined
- Error handling has been improved in the `handleViewUser` function
