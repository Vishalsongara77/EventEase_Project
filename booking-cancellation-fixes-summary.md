# Booking Cancellation Fixes Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Missing Cancel Booking Endpoint (404 Error)
**Problem**: Frontend was getting `404 (Not Found)` when trying to cancel bookings because the `PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel` endpoint didn't exist in the backend.

**Solution**: Added the missing endpoint to `backend/simple-server.js` with proper validation and business logic.

### 2. Redux Store Update Issue (400 Error)
**Problem**: After fixing the 404 error, users were getting `400 (Bad Request)` errors when trying to cancel already cancelled bookings. The Redux store wasn't properly updating booking status due to `_id` vs `id` field inconsistency.

**Solution**: Fixed the `bookingSlice.js` to use `id` instead of `_id` when updating bookings in the Redux store.

## Detailed Fixes

### Backend Fix: Added Cancel Booking Endpoint

**File**: `backend/simple-server.js`

Added the `PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel` endpoint with:

```javascript
app.put('/api/bookings/:id/cancel', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { id } = req.params;
        const db = readDB();
        
        // Find the booking
        const booking = db.bookings.find(b => b.id === id);
        if (!booking) {
            return res.status(404).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Booking not found'
            });
        }

        // Check if the booking belongs to the authenticated user
        if (booking.user !== req.user.id) {
            return res.status(403).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'You can only cancel your own bookings'
            });
        }

        // Check if booking is already cancelled
        if (booking.status === 'Cancelled') {
            return res.status(400).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Booking is already cancelled'
            });
        }

        // Find the associated event
        const event = db.events.find(e => e.id === booking.event);
        if (!event) {
            return res.status(404).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Associated event not found'
            });
        }

        // Update booking status
        booking.status = 'Cancelled';

        // Update event booked seats (subtract the cancelled seats)
        event.bookedSeats = Math.max(0, event.bookedSeats - booking.numberOfSeats);

        writeDB(db);

        res.status(200).json({
            success: true,
            message: 'Booking cancelled successfully',
            data: booking
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            success: false,
            message: 'Error cancelling booking',
            error: error.message
        });
    }
});
```

### Frontend Fix: Updated Redux Store Logic

**File**: `frontend/src/store/slices/bookingSlice.js`

Fixed the booking update logic in the `cancelBooking.fulfilled` case:

```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const index = state.bookings.findIndex(booking => booking._id === action.payload.data._id);

// After (correct)
const index = state.bookings.findIndex(booking => booking.id === action.payload.data.id);
```

## Features of the Cancel Booking System

### Backend Features
1. **Authentication**: Requires valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Users can only cancel their own bookings
3. **Validation**: 
   - Checks if booking exists
   - Prevents double-cancellation
   - Validates associated event exists
4. **Data Integrity**: 
   - Updates booking status to 'Cancelled'
   - Adjusts event capacity by subtracting cancelled seats
   - Ensures event capacity never goes negative
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for all scenarios

### Frontend Features
1. **UI Logic**: Cancel button only shows for cancellable bookings
2. **State Management**: Redux store properly updates after cancellation
3. **User Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/error states
4. **Loading States**: Shows "Cancelling..." during the process
5. **Confirmation**: Requires user confirmation before cancelling

## Testing Results

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Test successful cancellation
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "http://localhost:5000/api/bookings/1754045429888/cancel"
# Response: {"success":true,"message":"Booking cancelled successfully",...}

# Test double-cancellation (expected 400 error)
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" "http://localhost:5000/api/bookings/1754045429888/cancel"
# Response: {"success":false,"message":"Booking is already cancelled"}
```

### Frontend Testing
- ✅ Cancel button only appears for confirmed bookings
- ✅ Cancel button disappears after cancellation
- ✅ Booking status updates in UI after cancellation
- ✅ Toast notifications work correctly
- ✅ Loading states work during cancellation

## Business Logic

### Cancellation Rules
1. **User Ownership**: Only booking owner can cancel
2. **Status Check**: Cannot cancel already cancelled bookings
3. **Event Status**: Cannot cancel bookings for completed/ongoing events
4. **Capacity Management**: Event capacity is adjusted when booking is cancelled

### Data Flow
1. User clicks "Cancel" button
2. Frontend shows confirmation dialog
3. If confirmed, sends PUT request to backend
4. Backend validates and updates booking status
5. Backend adjusts event capacity
6. Frontend updates Redux store
7. UI reflects the cancelled status
8. Cancel button disappears

## Files Modified
- `backend/simple-server.js` - Added `PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel` endpoint
- `frontend/src/store/slices/bookingSlice.js` - Fixed Redux store update logic

## Impact
- ✅ Users can now cancel their bookings successfully
- ✅ No more 404 or 400 errors during cancellation
- ✅ Proper state management in frontend
- ✅ Data integrity maintained in backend
- ✅ User experience improved with proper feedback
