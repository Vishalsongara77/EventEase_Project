# Booking Cancel Endpoint Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend was encountering a `404 (Not Found)` error when trying to cancel a booking:
```
PUT http://localhost:5000/api/bookings/1754039093496/cancel 404 (Not Found)
```

This was happening because:
1. The frontend `bookingService.js` was making a `PUT` request to `/api/bookings/:id/cancel`
2. This endpoint didn't exist in the backend
3. The server was returning a 404 error

## Root Cause
The backend `simple-server.js` only had these booking endpoints:
- `POST /api/bookings` - Create a new booking
- `GET /api/bookings` - Get user's bookings

But it was missing:
- `PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel` - Cancel a booking

## Solution
Added the missing cancel booking endpoint to `backend/simple-server.js`:

```javascript
app.put('/api/bookings/:id/cancel', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
    try {
        const { id } = req.params;
        const db = readDB();
        
        // Find the booking
        const booking = db.bookings.find(b => b.id === id);
        if (!booking) {
            return res.status(404).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Booking not found'
            });
        }

        // Check if the booking belongs to the authenticated user
        if (booking.user !== req.user.id) {
            return res.status(403).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'You can only cancel your own bookings'
            });
        }

        // Check if booking is already cancelled
        if (booking.status === 'Cancelled') {
            return res.status(400).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Booking is already cancelled'
            });
        }

        // Find the associated event
        const event = db.events.find(e => e.id === booking.event);
        if (!event) {
            return res.status(404).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Associated event not found'
            });
        }

        // Update booking status
        booking.status = 'Cancelled';

        // Update event booked seats (subtract the cancelled seats)
        event.bookedSeats = Math.max(0, event.bookedSeats - booking.numberOfSeats);

        writeDB(db);

        res.status(200).json({
            success: true,
            message: 'Booking cancelled successfully',
            data: booking
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            success: false,
            message: 'Error cancelling booking',
            error: error.message
        });
    }
});
```

## Features of the New Endpoint
1. **Authentication**: Requires valid JWT token
2. **Authorization**: Users can only cancel their own bookings
3. **Validation**: Checks if booking exists and isn't already cancelled
4. **Data Integrity**: Updates both booking status and event capacity
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for various scenarios

## Business Logic
- **Booking Status Update**: Changes booking status to 'Cancelled'
- **Event Capacity Update**: Subtracts cancelled seats from event's booked seats
- **Data Consistency**: Ensures event capacity is never negative
- **User Security**: Prevents users from cancelling other users' bookings

## Testing
The endpoint was tested and confirmed working:
```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:5000/api/bookings/1754039093496/cancel
```

Response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Booking cancelled successfully",
  "data": {
    "id": "1754039093496",
    "user": "1754037677709",
    "event": "1754037677715",
    "numberOfSeats": 2,
    "totalAmount": 150,
    "status": "Cancelled",
    "bookingDate": "2025-08-01T09:04:53.496Z"
  }
}
```

## Impact
This fix resolves the 404 error and allows users to cancel their bookings through the frontend interface. The booking status is properly updated and the event capacity is adjusted accordingly.

## Files Modified
- `backend/simple-server.js` - Added the missing `PUT /api/bookings/:id/cancel` endpoint
