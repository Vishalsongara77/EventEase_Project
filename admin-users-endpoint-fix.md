# Admin Users Endpoint Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend `AdminUsers.jsx` was encountering a `SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<'` at line 63 when trying to fetch user details. This was happening because:

1. The frontend was making a request to `/api/admin/users/:id` endpoint
2. This endpoint didn't exist in the backend
3. The server was returning a 404 HTML page instead of JSON
4. The frontend was trying to parse the HTML as JSON, causing the `SyntaxError`

## Root Cause
The backend `simple-server.js` only had these admin endpoints:
- `/api/admin/dashboard` - Dashboard statistics
- `/api/admin/events` - List all events
- `/api/admin/users` - List all users

But it was missing:
- `/api/admin/users/:id` - Get specific user details

## Solution
Added the missing endpoint to `backend/simple-server.js`:

```javascript
app.get('/api/admin/users/:id', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
    try {
        if (req.user.role !== 'admin') {
            return res.status(403).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'Admin access required'
            });
        }

        const { id } = req.params;
        const db = readDB();
        
        const user = db.users.find(u => u.id === id);
        if (!user) {
            return res.status(404).json({
                success: false,
                message: 'User not found'
            });
        }

        // Get user's bookings
        const userBookings = db.bookings.filter(b => b.user === id);
        const bookingsWithDetails = userBookings.map(booking => {
            const event = db.events.find(e => e.id === booking.event);
            return { ...booking, event };
        });

        // Remove password from user object
        const { password, ...userWithoutPassword } = user;

        res.status(200).json({
            success: true,
            data: {
                ...userWithoutPassword,
                bookings: bookingsWithDetails
            }
        });
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            success: false,
            message: 'Error fetching user details',
            error: error.message
        });
    }
});
```

## Features of the New Endpoint
1. **Authentication**: Requires valid JWT token with admin role
2. **User Lookup**: Finds user by ID in the database
3. **Booking Details**: Includes all user's bookings with event details
4. **Security**: Removes password from the response
5. **Error Handling**: Proper error responses for missing users and server errors

## Testing
The endpoint was tested and confirmed working:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:5000/api/admin/users/1754037677709
```

Response includes user details and their bookings with event information.

## Impact
This fix resolves the `SyntaxError` in `AdminUsers.jsx` and allows the admin to view detailed user information including their booking history.
